# Writting Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code. 
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.


-In order to create code blocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`).
-Not to be confused with quotation mark (').

```
# Python program to print "Hello, CodeBlocks!"
print("Hello, CodeBlocks!")
